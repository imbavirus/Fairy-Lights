# 8.0.3

### Fixed

- **Recipes**: Fixed the majority of recipes not showing up in JEI. All items should now be craftable and visible.
- **Connections**: Fixed an issue where hanging lights/bunting connection ropes would become invisible when standing close to them.
- **Construction**: Fixed a bug where you couldn't place the second point of a connection if you were using an item from the Creative Menu.
