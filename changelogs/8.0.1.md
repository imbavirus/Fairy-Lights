# Version 8.0.1

## Bug Fixes

### Server
- **Crash Fix**: Fixed a startup crash caused by incorrect event handler registration (`ServerEventHandler`).
    - The `ServerEventHandler` contained static `@SubscribeEvent` methods but was being registered as an instance, leading to an `IllegalArgumentException`.
